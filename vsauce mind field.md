* modern definition of psych is study of behavior and mental processes
* we answer questions based on observations and facts
* mental processes are subjective experiences and they are not directly measurable
## nature vs nurture
* plato thought that certain knowledge is innate/inborn
* aristotle thought that all knowledege is aqcuired through experience. **philosophical empiricism**
* it's actually not nature *vs* nurture, it's the combination/interaction between them
* descarte: **dualism** is the idea that mind and body are separate things. Biology says "the mind is what the brain does" which counters this

## Wilhelm Wundt
* the father of psychology.
* used the scientific method
* established the first psych research lab
* univ of leipzig, ger (1879)
## edward titchener
* experiences could be broken down into structures
* **structuralism**
* reverse engineering experiences
* introspection (not very effective)
  * not objective
  * inconsistent
## william james
* established psych in US
* harvard
* **functionalism**
  * influeced by darwin
  * evolution influenced behaviors
  * benefits/funcitons of traits/behaviors
## charles darwin
* evolution
* adaptation in physiology and psychology
* animals adapt their behaviors
## sigmund freud
* first clinical psychologist
* developed views by talking to people in his clinical work
* **psychoanalytic theory**
  * emphasis on the unconscious
  * unconscious conflicts determine behavior
## behaviorism
* backlash to psychoanalytic theory
* mind = black box. don't care about it. Only care about behavior
* more observable
* **ivan pavlov**
  * discovered conditioned reflexes
  * conditioning
  * animals
* **john watson**
  * extended it to humans
  * conditioned a child to have a phobia. supported nurture
* **b f skinner**
## humanistic psych
* humans have potential
* self-determination, free-will, etc
* positive
* the word self-esteem came from these guys
* reaction to  negative implications of freud and external influence of behavioral
* **carl rogers**
* **abraham maslow**
* influenced **positive psychology** (modern thing, happiness)
## cognitive psych
* brought the mind back into psych
* analogy between computer and brain
* mental processes and their influence on behavior
* perception, thought, memory, reasoning, processing
## biological
* brain chemistry/neurotransmission
* **neuropsychopharmacology**
  * medicine for the mind
  * how drugs influence the brain
  * drugs influence neuro transmitters (like dopamine)
* human genome
  * 25,000 genes
* epigenomics
  * environment influences gene activation
* neuroscience
  * use MRIs to see what the brain is doing
## current fields
* biological psychology and neuroscience
* evolutionary psychology
* developmental psychology
* cognitive
* social
* personality
* positive psychology
* industrial/organizational
  * maximize productivity
* educational
  * maximize learning
* forensic
  * are they insane?
  * expert testimony
  * assess criminals
* clinical

## biases
* hindsight bias
  * the past makes sense and seems obvious when it's not
* overconfidence
* pareidolia
## scientific attitude
* curious
* skeptical
* humble
## critical thinking
* question things
* evidence
* skepticism
## scientific method
* theories organize what we observe and imply things that we can test
* reject/revise theories that aren't supported by evidence
* beware of confirmation bias
## description
* does not explain behavior; describes it
* case study
  * the plural of anecdote is not evidence
  * deep focus on small group
* naturalistic observations
  * look at large groups/patterns
* surveys
  * wording effects
  * random sampling
## correlation
* regression to the mean
  * after something gets weird, it goes back to normal
## experimentation
* cause and effect

# class
## science
* non-dogmatic: accepting of challenges to ideas, flexible
* skeptical: question everything
* empirical: objective, evidence
* cumulative: builds on itself
* falsifiable
---
* thesis (claim of truth), antithesis, synthesis (blending of theses)
* science is refuting things that are false, not proving the truth
## description
### phineas gage
* case study
* sent an iron through his head
* took some of his frontal lobe
* coma, woke up
* less capable, less temperate (bad temper), different personality
* still had a job
* evidence of brain plasticity
* supported brain <=> personality
* maybe it was PTSD and not the brain thing
### andrea yates
* killed her children
* loving mother before that
* heard voices saying the devil was after her kids
* showed signs of depression, attempted suicide (before)
* obsessive thoughts about childrens' future cause depression. Took medicine and it really helped
* she got depressed again after she had another kid and the husband thinks that depression led to the murder
---
* case studies are small sample, so be careful
* by the same logic, you may be an outlier so your perspective might be bad
* 1-7 disagree strongly-agree strongly = **likert scales**
## correlation
* r = correlation coefficient $\in \{-1,1\}$
* correlation â‰  causation
* correlation = prediction
## experiments
* operational definition of variables. Go into detail about how you measure
* confounding variables: other variables that the experiment didn't account for
# 1-18-18
* 25,000 genes in our genome (which is only 2% of our genome)
* the rest is non-coding dna
* that's stuff like telomeres
* 3 adj nucleotides are called a codon
* that's an amino acid
* these chain to make proteins
* they can be enzymes, receptor proteins in cell membrane
* maybe a gene gives you a short dopamine receptor, that changes how you deal with dopamine, that changes your behavior
* genes contain instructions for making proteins
## mutation
* errors in gene replication
* mutations accumulate over generations and are heritable
* usually neutral
* single nucleotide polymorphism (SNP)
  * one nucleotide changed
* foxp2 gene
  * all vertebrates
  * we have a mutated version
  * different by 2 amino acids
  * advantage in language production
## the KE family
* half the family had speech impediments
* normal in every other way
* the gene they found is foxp2
* remarkable connection between genes and cognition
## huntington's disease
* disturbance in motor output
* neurodegenerative
* fatal
* caused by a single gene: the huntington gene
* too many repetitions of a codon
* we all have the gene, but victims have an abnormal gene
* messes up neurons, causes them to kill themselves
* first disorder that you could get genetic tests for
* the more repetitions of the codon, the worse and earlier it is
## twin studies
* isolate nature and nurture effects since identical twins have the same genes
* identical twins have personality similarities
* even separated twins
## adoption studies
* traits of biological parents or foster parents?
* we can never know how much of something was attributed to genes vs environment for an individual, but we can know how much variation in a population is due to genes
---
* high heritability for intelligence, extra/introversion, neuroticism
* two separated twins had similar interests, laughs, etc.
* different environments caused rats to have different brains. More neurons, more connections, etc. yuge physical changes
* repeated practice at finger tapping task changes neuron development and functional activation. Altered brain size and activations
* stopping training made them LOSE the brain changes
* telomeres are responsible for aging
* stress releases hormones that accelerate shortening of telomeres
* interacting with others and experiencing emotions like compassion can actually affect telomeres and aging. Emotions release telomerase
* links between genes and early traumas/maltreatments and violent futures
* (gene + maltreatment) => violence
* gene =/> violence
* maltreatment => violence
* the genes accelerated the effects of maltreatment
