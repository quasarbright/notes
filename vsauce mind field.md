* modern definition of psych is study of behavior and mental processes
* we answer questions based on observations and facts
* mental processes are subjective experiences and they are not directly measurable
## nature vs nurture
* plato thought that certain knowledge is innate/inborn
* aristotle thought that all knowledege is aqcuired through experience. **philosophical empiricism**
* it's actually not nature *vs* nurture, it's the combination/interaction between them
* descarte: **dualism** is the idea that mind and body are separate things. Biology says "the mind is what the brain does" which counters this

## Wilhelm Wundt
* the father of psychology.
* used the scientific method
* established the first psych research lab
* univ of leipzig, ger (1879)
## edward titchener
* experiences could be broken down into structures
* **structuralism**
* reverse engineering experiences
* introspection (not very effective)
  * not objective
  * inconsistent
## william james
* established psych in US
* harvard
* **functionalism**
  * influeced by darwin
  * evolution influenced behaviors
  * benefits/funcitons of traits/behaviors
## charles darwin
* evolution
* adaptation in physiology and psychology
* animals adapt their behaviors
## sigmund freud
* first clinical psychologist
* developed views by talking to people in his clinical work
* **psychoanalytic theory**
  * emphasis on the unconscious
  * unconscious conflicts determine behavior
## behaviorism
* backlash to psychoanalytic theory
* mind = black box. don't care about it. Only care about behavior
* more observable
* **ivan pavlov**
  * discovered conditioned reflexes
  * conditioning
  * animals
* **john watson**
  * extended it to humans
  * conditioned a child to have a phobia. supported nurture
* **b f skinner**
## humanistic psych
* humans have potential
* self-determination, free-will, etc
* positive
* the word self-esteem came from these guys
* reaction to  negative implications of freud and external influence of behavioral
* **carl rogers**
* **abraham maslow**
* influenced **positive psychology** (modern thing, happiness)
## cognitive psych
* brought the mind back into psych
* analogy between computer and brain
* mental processes and their influence on behavior
* perception, thought, memory, reasoning, processing
## biological
* brain chemistry/neurotransmission
* **neuropsychopharmacology**
  * medicine for the mind
  * how drugs influence the brain
  * drugs influence neuro transmitters (like dopamine)
* human genome
  * 25,000 genes

## science
* non-dogmatic: accepting of challenges to ideas, flexible
* skeptical: question everything
* empirical: objective, evidence
* cumulative: builds on itself
* falsifiable
---
* thesis (claim of truth), antithesis, synthesis (blending of theses)
* science is refuting things that are false, not proving the truth
## description
### phineas gage
* case study
* sent an iron through his head
* took some of his frontal lobe
* coma, woke up
* less capable, less temperate (bad temper), different personality
* still had a job
* evidence of brain plasticity
* supported brain <=> personality
* maybe it was PTSD and not the brain thing
### andrea yates
* killed her children
* loving mother before that
* heard voices saying the devil was after her kids
* showed signs of depression, attempted suicide (before)
* obsessive thoughts about childrens' future cause depression. Took medicine and it really helped
* she got depressed again after she had another kid and the husband thinks that depression led to the murder
---
* case studies are small sample, so be careful
* by the same logic, you may be an outlier so your perspective might be bad
* 1-7 disagree strongly-agree strongly = **likert scales**
## correlation
* r = correlation coefficient $\in \{-1,1\}$
* correlation â‰  causation
* correlation = prediction
## experiments
* operational definition of variables. Go into detail about how you measure
* confounding variables: other variables that the experiment didn't account for
# 1-18-18
* 25,000 genes in our genome (which is only 2% of our genome)
* the rest is non-coding dna
* that's stuff like telomeres
* 3 adj nucleotides are called a codon
* that's an amino acid
* these chain to make proteins
* they can be enzymes, receptor proteins in cell membrane
* maybe a gene gives you a short dopamine receptor, that changes how you deal with dopamine, that changes your behavior
* genes contain instructions for making proteins
## mutation
* errors in gene replication
* mutations accumulate over generations and are heritable
* usually neutral
* single nucleotide polymorphism (SNP)
  * one nucleotide changed
* foxp2 gene
  * all vertebrates
  * we have a mutated version
  * different by 2 amino acids
  * advantage in language production
## the KE family
* half the family had speech impediments
* normal in every other way
* the gene they found is foxp2
* remarkable connection between genes and cognition
## huntington's disease
* disturbance in motor output
* neurodegenerative
* fatal
* caused by a single gene: the huntington gene
* too many repetitions of a codon
* we all have the gene, but victims have an abnormal gene
* messes up neurons, causes them to kill themselves
* first disorder that you could get genetic tests for
* the more repetitions of the codon, the worse and earlier it is
## twin studies
* isolate nature and nurture effects since identical twins have the same genes
* identical twins have personality similarities
* even separated twins
## adoption studies
* traits of biological parents or foster parents?
* we can never know how much of something was attributed to genes vs environment for an individual, but we can know how much variation in a population is due to genes
---
* high heritability for intelligence, extra/introversion, neuroticism
* two separated twins had similar interests, laughs, etc.
* different environments caused rats to have different brains. More neurons, more connections, etc. yuge physical changes
* repeated practice at finger tapping task changes neuron development and functional activation. Altered brain size and activations
* stopping training made them LOSE the brain changes
* telomeres are responsible for aging
* stress releases hormones that accelerate shortening of telomeres
* interacting with others and experiencing emotions like compassion can actually affect telomeres and aging. Emotions release telomerase
* links between genes and early traumas/maltreatments and violent futures
* (gene + maltreatment) => violence
* gene =/> violence
* maltreatment => violence
* the genes accelerated the effects of maltreatment

# class
* quiz due friday, will be up today after class
* covers research methods, gene behavior, and stuff from today
* 30 MC questions
* open book
## prenatal development
* **zygote** is a fertilized egg
* zygote -> embryo
## teratogens
* chemicals that can enter the placenta and harm development
* pregnancy symptoms like nausea protect the fetus from teratogens, so they're beneficial and probably are products of evolution
* symptoms overlap with period of extreme fetal vulnerability
* alcohol is a big teratogen
* fetal alcohol spectrum disorder
  * small brains
  * deformations
  * intellectual disabilities
  * prone to seizures
  * ADHD
## newborns
* born with reflexes
  * sucking, rooting (orienting mouth towards things touching face), grasping, crying
* comforted by touch, rocking, familiar noises
* comforted when they smell mother's milk
* like parents' voices
* recognize caregiver faces
* aren't bothered by a dog barking if the dog was barking while the baby was in the womb.
## temperament
* a baby's reactivity and intensity
* behaviorally inhibited
  * shy
  * fearful
* behaviorally uninhibited
  * bold
  * positive
* uninhibited are cool, chill babies
* do these temperaments change?
## experiment
* 4 months old -> 4 years
* uninhibited mostly sticks (80%)
  * why do some people flip? (5%)
  * maybe abuse
* inhibited either sticks or becomes variable(sometimes fearful, sometimes not). about half and half
* 12% inhibited flip to positive
## video
* same temperamental differences in monkeys
* environmental influences on temperament in monkeys
  * environment overrides genetic, original temperament
  * same in humans
---
* inhibited => high neuroticism later
## attachment
* how do attachments form?
* what factors facilitate it?
* **Harry Harlow's** monkey experiments
  * feed baby = baby attached? Harlow didn't think so
  * Harlow thought it was also comfort based, not just nourishment
  * he had a wireframe mother monkey with a food bottle, and a cloth mother that looked like a monkey with no food bottle
  * the wireframe was literally a cylinder with a bottle
  * the wireframe-nursed monkey was afraid when he entered the room, the cloth-nursed monkey ran to his cloth mother, played with it, and explored the room curiously and happily
  * therefore feeding isn't all there is to attachment
* similar thing with incubated babies vs babies that were regularly held
* being held made them healthier
* kids from Russian orphanages weren't held much, just fed
* they developed emotional problems
* giving a baby love is essential for its emotional and physical future
* but how does this happen biologically?
* oxytocin
  * hormone that helps with formation of attachments
  * lack of love as a baby => little oxytocin release in the future => difficulty forming attachments
## maternal care in rats
* epigenetic effect
* less expression of receptor genes in the brain depending on maternal care
## attachment theory
* **john bowlby**
  * influenced by darwin
  * it's an evolved mechanism that helps helpless babies
* **mary ainsworth**
  * classic procedure for classifying patterns of attachment
  * the "strange situation paradigm" and attachment styles
    * put baby and parent in a strange situation
    * record how they react
    * ex: letting them in a room with toys and some stranger comes in, then the parent leaves. how does the kid react?
  * styles
    * secure attachment (60%)
      * comfortable to explore if mom is there
      * ok with stranger
      * signal needs when stressed
      * seek contact, ok with loneliness
      * comforted when mom comes back
    * insecure
      * avoidant (20%)
        * little exploring
        * avoid mom (independent)
        * ok with separation
        * treat stranger like parent
      * anxious-ambivalent (20%)
        * almost no exploration
        * presence of parent not enough to comfort
        * don't like stranger
        * mixed reaction to mom's comfort (sometimes clingy, sometimes angry)
* high levels of warmth =>
  * secure attachment
  * independence (coddling =/> over-dependence)
  * social competence
  * high self-esteem
  * low aggression
* attachment is based on expectations we learn to have
* expecting parents to be dependable leads to secure vs anxious vs avoidant (avoidant is from lowest expectation of dependability)
* attachment changes from parents to peers
* from peers to romantic partners
* secure romantic attachment style
  * easily trusting
  * intimate
  * low worrying
  * responsive to needs
* avoidant
  * lots of brief relationships
  * need a lot of space in a relationship
* anxious or ambivalent
  * fear of rejection
  * fear of lack of reciprocation
* could be weird if you have one style with mom and another one with dad
