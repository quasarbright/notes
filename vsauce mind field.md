* modern definition of psych is study of behavior and mental processes
* we answer questions based on observations and facts
* mental processes are subjective experiences and they are not directly measurable
## nature vs nurture
* plato thought that certain knowledge is innate/inborn
* aristotle thought that all knowledege is aqcuired through experience. **philosophical empiricism**
* it's actually not nature *vs* nurture, it's the combination/interaction between them
* descarte: **dualism** is the idea that mind and body are separate things. Biology says "the mind is what the brain does" which counters this

## Wilhelm Wundt

## science
* non-dogmatic: accepting of challenges to ideas, flexible
* skeptical: question everything
* empirical: objective, evidence
* cumulative: builds on itself
* falsifiable
---
* thesis (claim of truth), antithesis, synthesis (blending of theses)
* science is refuting things that are false, not proving the truth
## description
### phineas gage
* case study
* sent an iron through his head
* took some of his frontal lobe
* coma, woke up
* less capable, less temperate (bad temper), different personality
* still had a job
* evidence of brain plasticity
* supported brain <=> personality
* maybe it was PTSD and not the brain thing
### andrea yates
* killed her children
* loving mother before that
* heard voices saying the devil was after her kids
* showed signs of depression, attempted suicide (before)
* obsessive thoughts about childrens' future cause depression. Took medicine and it really helped
* she got depressed again after she had another kid and the husband thinks that depression led to the murder
---
* case studies are small sample, so be careful
* by the same logic, you may be an outlier so your perspective might be bad
* 1-7 disagree strongly-agree strongly = **likert scales**
## correlation
* r = correlation coefficient $\in \{-1,1\}$
* correlation â‰  causation
* correlation = prediction
## experiments
* operational definition of variables. Go into detail about how you measure
* confounding variables: other variables that the experiment didn't account for
# 1-18-18
* 25,000 genes in our genome (which is only 2% of our genome)
* the rest is non-coding dna
* that's stuff like telomeres
* 3 adj nucleotides are called a codon
* that's an amino acid
* these chain to make proteins
* they can be enzymes, receptor proteins in cell membrane
* maybe a gene gives you a short dopamine receptor, that changes how you deal with dopamine, that changes your behavior
* genes contain instructions for making proteins
## mutation
* errors in gene replication
* mutations accumulate over generations and are heritable
* usually neutral
* single nucleotide polymorphism (SNP)
  * one nucleotide changed
* foxp2 gene
  * all vertebrates
  * we have a mutated version
  * different by 2 amino acids
  * advantage in language production
## the KE family
* half the family had speech impediments
* normal in every other way
* the gene they found is foxp2
* remarkable connection between genes and cognition
## huntington's disease
* disturbance in motor output
* neurodegenerative
* fatal
* caused by a single gene: the huntington gene
* too many repetitions of a codon
* we all have the gene, but victims have an abnormal gene
* messes up neurons, causes them to kill themselves
* first disorder that you could get genetic tests for
* the more repetitions of the codon, the worse and earlier it is
## twin studies
* isolate nature and nurture effects since identical twins have the same genes
* identical twins have personality similarities
* even separated twins
## adoption studies
* traits of biological parents or foster parents?
* we can never know how much of something was attributed to genes vs environment for an individual, but we can know how much variation in a population is due to genes
---
* high heritability for intelligence, extra/introversion, neuroticism
* two separated twins had similar interests, laughs, etc.
* different environments caused rats to have different brains. More neurons, more connections, etc. yuge physical changes
* repeated practice at finger tapping task changes neuron development and functional activation. Altered brain size and activations
* stopping training made them LOSE the brain changes
* telomeres are responsible for aging
* stress releases hormones that accelerate shortening of telomeres
* interacting with others and experiencing emotions like compassion can actually affect telomeres and aging. Emotions release telomerase
* links between genes and early traumas/maltreatments and violent futures
* (gene + maltreatment) => violence
* gene =/> violence
* maltreatment => violence
* the genes accelerated the effects of maltreatment

# class
* quiz due friday, will be up today after class
* covers research methods, gene behavior, and stuff from today
* 30 MC questions
* open book
## prenatal development
* **zygote** is a fertilized egg
* zygote -> embryo
## teratogens
* chemicals that can enter the placenta and harm development
* pregnancy symptoms like nausea protect the fetus from teratogens, so they're beneficial and probably are products of evolution
* symptoms overlap with period of extreme fetal vulnerability
* alcohol is a big teratogen
* fetal alcohol spectrum disorder
  * small brains
  * deformations
  * intellectual disabilities
  * prone to seizures
  * ADHD
## newborns
* born with reflexes
  * sucking, rooting (orienting mouth towards things touching face), grasping, crying
* comforted by touch, rocking, familiar noises
* comforted when they smell mother's milk
* like parents' voices
* recognize caregiver faces
* aren't bothered by a dog barking if the dog was barking while the baby was in the womb.
## temperament
* a baby's reactivity and intensity
* behaviorally inhibited
  * shy
  * fearful
* behaviorally uninhibited
  * bold
  * positive
* uninhibited are cool, chill babies
* do these temperaments change?
## experiment
* 4 months old -> 4 years
* uninhibited mostly sticks (80%)
  * why do some people flip? (5%)
  * maybe abuse
* inhibited either sticks or becomes variable(sometimes fearful, sometimes not). about half and half
* 12% inhibited flip to positive
## video
* same temperamental differences in monkeys
* environmental influences on temperament in monkeys
  * environment overrides genetic, original temperament
  * same in humans
---
* inhibited => high neuroticism later
## attachment
* how do attachments form?
* what factors facilitate it?
* **Harry Harlow's** monkey experiments
  * feed baby = baby attached? Harlow didn't think so
  * Harlow thought it was also comfort based, not just nourishment
  * he had a wireframe mother monkey with a food bottle, and a cloth mother that looked like a monkey with no food bottle
  * the wireframe was literally a cylinder with a bottle
  * the wireframe-nursed monkey was afraid when he entered the room, the cloth-nursed monkey ran to his cloth mother, played with it, and explored the room curiously and happily
  * therefore feeding isn't all there is to attachment
* similar thing with incubated babies vs babies that were regularly held
* being held made them healthier
* kids from Russian orphanages weren't held much, just fed
* they developed emotional problems
* giving a baby love is essential for its emotional and physical future
* but how does this happen biologically?
* oxytocin
  * hormone that helps with formation of attachments
  * lack of love as a baby => little oxytocin release in the future => difficulty forming attachments
## maternal care in rats
* epigenetic effect
* less expression of receptor genes in the brain depending on maternal care
## attachment theory
* **john bowlby**
  * influenced by darwin
  * it's an evolved mechanism that helps helpless babies
* **mary ainsworth**
  * classic procedure for classifying patterns of attachment
  * the "strange situation paradigm" and attachment styles
    * put baby and parent in a strange situation
    * record how they react
    * ex: letting them in a room with toys and some stranger comes in, then the parent leaves. how does the kid react?
  * styles
    * secure attachment (60%)
      * comfortable to explore if mom is there
      * ok with stranger
      * signal needs when stressed
      * seek contact, ok with loneliness
      * comforted when mom comes back
    * insecure
      * avoidant (20%)
        * little exploring
        * avoid mom (independent)
        * ok with separation
        * treat stranger like parent
      * anxious-ambivalent (20%)
        * almost no exploration
        * presence of parent not enough to comfort
        * don't like stranger
        * mixed reaction to mom's comfort (sometimes clingy, sometimes angry)
* high levels of warmth =>
  * secure attachment
  * independence (coddling =/> over-dependence)
  * social competence
  * high self-esteem
  * low aggression
* attachment is based on expectations we learn to have
* expecting parents to be dependable leads to secure vs anxious vs avoidant (avoidant is from lowest expectation of dependability)
* attachment changes from parents to peers
* from peers to romantic partners
* secure romantic attachment style
  * easily trusting
  * intimate
  * low worrying
  * responsive to needs
* avoidant
  * lots of brief relationships
  * need a lot of space in a relationship
* anxious or ambivalent
  * fear of rejection
  * fear of lack of reciprocation
* could be weird if you have one style with mom and another one with dad

![neuron diagram](https://cdn.discordapp.com/attachments/502956287043174407/539855095978917953/unknown.png)
* myelin is a fatty tissue that covers axons and speeds up impulses. Up until you're 25, you get more and more myelin, which increases neural efficiency, judgement, and self control
* glial cells support, feed, and maintain neurons, since they can't feed themselves. they also give myelin and "chat" with neurons, aiding in information transmission and memory.
* Einstein had normal neurons, but a lot of glial cells
* neurons fire all-or-nothing, but a strong stimulus would cause more neurons to fire and more frequently
# class
* cell body = soma
* dendrites recieve, axons send
* axons can be long. like half your height
* nodes of ranvier: myelin wrappings are in "globs", not just one big wrapping. spaces of raw axon between are the nodes
## types
* sensory (body -> nervous system)
* motor neurons (nervous -> body)
* interneurons (connectors within spinal cord and brain)
## mirror neurons
* why do we get so invested in watching other people?
* same neuron fired when doing an action as seeing someone do an action
* autism may have to do with broken mirror neurons. they don't have the response
* connected with learning
* social brain system which is only useful with others
* experts show more mirror activation than novices
## how they work
* resting potential
  * measured in electrical potential difference
  * potential difference between inside and outside of neuron at rest
  * inside = -70 mV
  * sodium ions outside neuron
  * potassium ions inside neuron
  * higher concentration of sodium on outside than potassium on inside means there's relatively more positive charge on the outside
  * voltage spike = impulse. sodium channels open up, sodium floods the inside, voltage reaches action potential,  potassium leaves, it goes back to resting potential.
  * sodium/potassium pump restores ion balance and returns the neuron to the resting potential. VERY expensive
  * all of this happens at the beginning of the axon
* action potential
* synaptic neurotransmission
* propagation of action potential
  * the action potential goes down the axon
  * wave of sodium in and potassium out
  * no myelin = continuous conduction
    * potential signal has to go down the whole axon
  * myelinated = saltatory conduction
    * "skips" the myelinated parts. goes from node to node
* gray matter is somas and dendrites
* white matter is myelinated axons and glial cells
## synapse and neurotransmitters
* gap between neurons = synapse
* when potential reaches terminal, neurotransmitters get released to the synapse
* end of axon has synaptic vesicles
* the action potential pushes these to the pre-synaptic membrane and they dump the neurotransmitters into it
* these neurotransmitters are received in receptor sites of dendrites
* gap is nanometers long
* specific neurotransmitters are received in specific receptor sites (lock and key)
* transmission =/> action potential in next neuron
* excitatory neurotransmitters  depolarize the post-synaptic membrane increasing the likelihood of action potential
* inhibitory neurotransmitters hyperpolarize and decrease likelihood
* these communications are summed and a threshold determines an all-or-nothing response in the next neuron
## signal termination
* reuptake
  * sucking the neurotransmitters back into the axon
  * SSRIs prevent reuptake of serotonin. This leaves them in the synapse and they just keep bouncing around and getting received, making it seem like there's more serotonin. they block the "vacuum" that sucks the neurotransmitters back in
* enzyme reactivation
  * break apart the neurotransmitters and then let the parts get sucked back in
## neurotransmitters
* acetylcholine is responsible for muscle signals
* dopamine is rewards
* norepinephrine mood and arousal
* serotonin sleep, wakefulness, eating, aggression, mood regulation
* gaba primary, common inhibitory signal. anxiety and sleep/arousal
* glutamate common excitatory.
* endorphine pain relief and stress. eating behavior
* all excitatory except gaba
* usually, one neuron releases only one neurotransmitters

# reading
* cultural/social expectations of a drug can placebo
* **neuroadaptation**: brain chemistry adapts to offset the effects of a drug, developing a tolerance for it
* heavy drinking can suppress REM sleep, where your brain processes and remembers what happened that day. this leads to lack of memories
* real addiction vs "omg i'm so addicted to ..." is about compulsion, obsession, dysfunction, and uncontrollable use despite knowledge of negative effects
* quitting smoking is equally successful gradually or abruptly
* withdrawal symptoms include craving, insomnia, anxiety, irritability, and distractibility. these dissipate in 6 months
* cocaine inhibits reuptake of serotonin, dopamine, and norepinephrine, meaning they get received more than they should
* psychoactive drugs:
